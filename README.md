# OP Script Hub
Made this so fast -_-

This script was just made for fun

DM me at antis1212 on discord for any bugs and stuff

I do not recommend using this on android. some guis including mine can't be moved

use this to execute it:
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.github.com/AntIsBadAtCoding/OP_Script_Hub/blob/fb0c414431736045c87bb1da227afa05ebc11b09/OP%20DW%20Script%20hub"))()
```
